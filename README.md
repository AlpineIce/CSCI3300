## Features
* 

## Dependencies
* Your favorite web browser
* Your preferred method of getting around cross-origin resource sharing security limitations, with the 
  recommended method being to use the live server extension in VS Code, and launching the repo in a live 
  server.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone this repo with `{ https://github.com/AlpineIce/CSCI3300.git }`
2. If using live server, open the repo in VS Code, and click on the go live button provided by the live 
   server extension, which should be at the bottom right corner.
3. If a webpage didn't automatically open up, type the IP and port of the server that started (this should 
   be visible in the settings of the extension). It should look something like `{ 127.0.0.1:5500 }`
